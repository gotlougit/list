# list
A command-line program that makes a nice little list in plaintext. More features to come!

## Features
* Small command-line interface
* Uses only the Python Standard Library
* As portable as possible
* Small codebase

## Instructions
Soon to come, but right now, it is to be executed as a script.

### For POSIX-based operating systems-

Open up the Terminal and then type the following commands-

     cd path/to/list/
     ./main.py

### For Windows-

Open up the Command Prompt and then type the following commands-

     cd path\to\list\
     python3 main.py
 
 Note that you must have python3 set in your PATH variable in order for this to work.
 
 ## So now that all the boring stuff's out of the way....
 ### How does it all work?
 * list should open up with this screen-
